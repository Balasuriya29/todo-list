# Be Prepared

## Description

* Be Prepared is a task project that I was given in the time of my internship @Rently
* This is a normal todo app with all CRUD functionalities with my own cool features gives a smooth UI/UX(I hope so...üòÅ)
* This was my project during the training in react native after Understand Flex, so the code is improvisied with every commit as I learned new concepts
* I have used both class and functional components with redux implemented in both to understand it along with sagas
* The Files Structure and code readability - at most Developer Standards
* Working on One Last Feature will Update Soon...üöÄ
