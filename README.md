# Be Prepared

## Description

* This contains the same project from the main branch but as mentioned there, this is made with **React Native CLI**.
* Most of the process, UI, components, pages are same, I just migrated from my EXPO CLI project
* The thing I learned and did was for every assest or new package that I install, I needed to link some of them, so that they get linked and created with repect to their platform files.
* Changed Packages: 

        1. expo icons -> react-native-elements 
        (which internally use react-native-vector-icons) 
        
        2. expo-image-picker -> react-native-image-picker 
        (no difference even the methods are with similar name)

        3. expo-google-fonts/poppins -> local fonts 
        (.ttf files from google are linked)
